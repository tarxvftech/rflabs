This is a directory of amateur friendly labs with RF equipment.

If you'd like to be listed as having test equipment that you are willing
to share, lend, or instruct hams with, send a pull request following
the examples in the `data/locations/labs.json` file.  
If it builds, I'll accept it and it'll get pushed to the website.

Note: Currently it has two makerspaces that are members only. They are
there only to show a few more examples.

This is intended to be a listing of various amateur-friendly RF labs,
and their equipment, open to amateur use or otherwise available for borrow
or rent.  The owner of the lab or equipment may or may not also be willing
to help, or may require use of their equipment only with supervision -
you should ask! COVID restrictions may make it even harder.

Equipment owners that are willing to be contacted by amateurs in need
of some quick testing, please visit GITHUB HERE to add yourself to
the listing.

Note: Makerspaces may be listed here, but ideally only if they have day
passes or some other ad-hoc use of their RF equipment.  I've listed a
few just to jump start the directory, even though they are restricted
to members only.  Later I intend to remove them, as I'd like this list
to be only for places that don't require a monthly membership.

Members-only makerspaces are best found at https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspaces

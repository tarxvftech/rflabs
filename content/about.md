This is intended to be a listing of various amateur-friendly RF labs,
and their equipment, open to amateur use or otherwise available for borrow
or rent.  The owner of the lab or equipment may or may not also be willing
to help, or may require use of their equipment only with supervision -
you should ask!  COVID restrictions may make it even harder.

The exact details are out of scope for this directory, but when you
approach one of the hams or labs listed here, I suggest you know exactly
what you want to test, even if not exactly how to test it. Ham radio
is about learning and experimentation, and the people who have listed
themselves here are willing to help - just be respectful of their time.

Equipment owners that are willing to be contacted by amateurs
in need of some quick testing, please visit pull request
https://github.com/tarxvftech/rflabs to add yourself to the listing;
or, email me and I'm happy to do it for you ( rflabs at tarxvf dot tech ).

Note: Makerspaces may be listed here, but ideally only if they have
day passes or some other ad-hoc use of their RF equipment without a
full membership.  I've listed a few just to jump start the directory,
even though they appear to be restricted to members only.  Later I intend
to remove them, as I'd like this list to be only for places that don't
require a monthly membership.

Members-only makerspaces are best found at https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspaces
